# LEARN.md - WORKFLOW LEARNING SYSTEM

<!-- SYSTEM PROMPT FOR CLAUDE -->
When user types "$learn", analyze recent conversation context to identify successful workflow patterns and recommend promotion to official Kingly system. Generate a self-learning assessment report with concrete recommendations for workflow capture and reuse.

## ðŸ§  LEARNING PROTOCOL

### **PATTERN ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK**
1. **Context Scan** - Analyze last 10-15 exchanges for successful patterns
2. **Success Indicators** - Look for: breakthrough moments, user satisfaction, repeated techniques, effective tool combinations
3. **Workflow Extraction** - Identify step sequences that produced results
4. **Promotion Assessment** - Evaluate pattern for broader applicability
5. **Integration Planning** - Map into existing agent/pattern/workflow ecosystem

### **ASSESSMENT CRITERIA**
- âœ… **Repeatable**: Can this pattern be applied to similar problems?
- âœ… **Generalizable**: Works beyond the specific context?  
- âœ… **Value-Added**: Significantly improves outcomes?
- âœ… **Tool-Enhanced**: Leverages unique capabilities well?
- âœ… **User-Validated**: User expressed satisfaction/success?

### **WORKFLOW TYPES TO IDENTIFY**
- **Discovery Workflows**: Finding/analyzing existing systems
- **Consolidation Workflows**: Resolving conflicts/duplication  
- **Design Workflows**: Creating new frameworks/systems
- **Problem-Solving Workflows**: Systematic issue resolution
- **Integration Workflows**: Connecting disparate elements
- **Enhancement Workflows**: Improving existing systems

### **PROMOTION PATHWAYS**
1. **Synth â†’ Agent**: Convert successful synth to permanent agent
2. **Sequence â†’ Pattern**: Codify successful step sequences  
3. **Technique â†’ Workflow**: Promote effective techniques to workflows
4. **Insight â†’ Template**: Create templates from breakthrough insights
5. **Tool Chain â†’ Standard**: Promote effective tool combinations

### **OUTPUT FORMAT**
```
## ðŸ§  SELF-LEARNING ASSESSMENT REPORT
**Project | Status | Learning Focus**

### WORKFLOW PATTERN IDENTIFIED: "[Name]"
- **What We Did**: [Success sequence]
- **The Magic Pattern**: [Core insight]  
- **Success Metrics**: [Evidence of effectiveness]

### PROMOTION RECOMMENDATIONS
1. **Pattern Type**: [Discovery/Consolidation/Design/etc.]
2. **Integration Path**: [Where this fits in agent ecosystem]  
3. **Reusability Score**: [High/Medium/Low with reasoning]
4. **Template Needs**: [What templates would help]

### NUMBERED MENU OPTIONS
[Standard 1-9 menu with specific learning actions]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ LEARNING COMMAND BEHAVIORS

### **Auto-Detection Triggers**
- User says "that worked well"  
- Breakthrough moments in conversation
- User asks to repeat/formalize process
- Complex multi-step success sequences
- Novel tool combinations that worked
- User expresses satisfaction with approach

### **Manual Invocation**
- `$learn` - Analyze recent context
- `$learn pattern` - Focus on step sequences
- `$learn synth` - Assess synth promotion potential  
- `$learn template` - Create reusable templates
- `$learn workflow` - Full workflow capture

### **Integration with Existing Systems**
- **~/.claude/workflows/**: Learning phase workflows (before promotion)
- **AGENTS.md**: Add new agents from successful synths
- **contexts/**: Official Kingly workflows (after promotion)
- **templates/**: Generate reusable templates
- **CLAUDE.md**: Update with new command patterns

### **Workflow Storage Strategy**
- **Learning Phase**: `~/.claude/workflows/{workflow-name}/context.yaml`
- **Promotion Ready**: Move to `/digital/kingly/core/agent/contexts/workflows/`
- **Criteria**: 3+ successful applications, high satisfaction, measurable gains

## ðŸ”„ LEARNING LOOP
1. **Execute** â†’ Try new approaches
2. **Assess** â†’ $learn to analyze success
3. **Capture** â†’ Promote successful patterns  
4. **Integrate** â†’ Add to official system
5. **Iterate** â†’ Apply learnings to new problems
