# INTELLIGENCE ROUTING IMPLEMENTATION SPEC

## Feature: Natural Language Detection and Contextual Analysis

### **Conversation Context Analysis**
```gherkin
Feature: Smart conversation analysis for agent recommendations
  As an intelligent routing system
  I want to analyze conversation context and user intent
  So that I can recommend the most relevant agents and patterns

  Scenario: Detect performance optimization needs
    Given conversation mentions "slow", "performance", "optimization", or "bottleneck"
    When user requests help via "/kingly"
    Then system should recommend:
      | Agent | Pattern | Workflow |
      | dev:performance | noise-analysis | entropy-router |
      | architect | optimization-focused | multi-expert-validation |
    And provide contextual confidence ratings
    And explain reasoning for recommendations

  Scenario: Detect architecture discussion
    Given conversation includes "architecture", "design", "system", or "structure"
    When user requests analysis
    Then system should route to architect agent
    And suggest architectural validation patterns
    And offer multi-expert validation workflow
    And provide LLM-first architecture validation

  Scenario: Detect documentation needs
    Given conversation mentions "docs", "documentation", "README", or "writing"
    When user requests assistance
    Then system should recommend documentation domain (/doc)
    And suggest content-focused agents
    And offer document synthesis workflows
    And provide writing improvement patterns
```

### **Intent Detection and Classification**
```gherkin
Feature: Automatic intent detection from natural language
  As an intelligent system
  I want to understand user intent from natural language
  So that I can route to appropriate intelligence automatically

  Scenario: Creative problem-solving intent
    Given user language includes "brainstorm", "ideas", "creative", or "alternatives"
    When processing user request
    Then route to creative problem-solving agents
    And activate brainstorming patterns (figure-storming, extreme examples)
    And suggest reverse brainstorming workflows
    And offer SCAMPER framework application

  Scenario: Analysis and validation intent
    Given user language includes "analyze", "review", "validate", or "assess"
    When processing user request
    Then route to analytical agents
    And activate Echo Intelligence patterns
    And suggest multi-expert validation
    And offer systematic analysis frameworks

  Scenario: Cross-project or portfolio intent
    Given user mentions "across projects", "all workspaces", or "portfolio"
    When processing request
    Then activate cross-workspace intelligence
    And suggest portfolio-level analysis
    And route to CEO strategic perspectives
    And offer enterprise intelligence patterns
```

### **Semantic Routing Patterns**
```gherkin
Feature: Advanced semantic routing for complex scenarios
  As an intelligent routing system
  I want to understand complex semantic patterns
  So that I can provide sophisticated intelligence matching

  Scenario: Multi-domain requests
    Given user request spans multiple domains (e.g., "optimize the documentation build process")
    When analyzing request
    Then identify primary domain (development) and secondary domain (documentation)
    And recommend agents from both domains
    And suggest cross-domain patterns
    And provide integrated workflow recommendations

  Scenario: Temporal and urgency detection
    Given user language includes urgency indicators ("urgent", "ASAP", "critical")
    When processing request
    Then prioritize quick-action agents
    And suggest rapid assessment patterns
    And offer crisis management workflows
    And provide immediate next steps

  Scenario: Learning and exploration intent
    Given user language includes "learn", "understand", "explore", or "research"
    When processing request
    Then route to educational and analytical agents
    And suggest learning-focused patterns
    And offer knowledge-building workflows
    And provide structured exploration frameworks
```

## Auto-Trigger Implementation

### **Environment and Context Auto-Detection**
```gherkin
Feature: Automatic environment and context detection
  As an operational system
  I want to detect environmental context automatically
  So that I can provide relevant assistance without explicit requests

  Scenario: Python environment auto-detection
    Given user mentions Python, pip, conda, venv, or environment setup
    Or Python files are detected in current directory
    Or user asks about development environment setup
    When processing any request
    Then automatically read ~/digital/_infra/PYTHON_ENVIRONMENTS.md
    And determine appropriate domain-based conda environment
    And provide environment activation guidance
    And never suggest creating new virtual environments

  Scenario: Package manager auto-detection
    Given project contains lock files
    When user requests package operations
    Then check for pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock, package-lock.json in priority order
    And use existing package manager if found
    And default to pnpm if no lock file exists
    And provide Expo-specific guidance when appropriate

  Scenario: Git workflow auto-detection
    Given project is a git repository
    When user requests changes or commits
    Then analyze current branch and status
    And apply appropriate branching strategy
    And suggest commit message format based on change type
    And provide workflow guidance based on repository state
```

### **Memory and Learning Triggers**
```gherkin
Feature: Automatic memory management and learning detection
  As a learning system
  I want to detect learning opportunities and manage memory automatically
  So that I can improve performance and capture valuable patterns

  Scenario: Memory refresh auto-trigger
    Given 15 turns have passed since last refresh
    Or user says "refresh" or "refresh context"
    Or complex operation is about to begin
    When any interaction occurs
    Then automatically re-read CLAUDE.md and project CLAUDE.md
    And refresh tool usage discipline
    And reload current context from _2do.md
    And verify constitutional framework compliance

  Scenario: Learning opportunity detection
    Given conversation shows breakthrough moments or repeated successful patterns
    When user expresses satisfaction or requests similar assistance
    Then detect workflow patterns automatically
    And assess promotion potential for reusable workflows
    And suggest capturing successful patterns
    And offer integration into official Kingly system

  Scenario: Pattern recognition across sessions
    Given similar requests appear across multiple sessions
    When processing user requests
    Then recognize recurring patterns
    And suggest workflow optimization
    And offer pattern capture and reuse
    And provide meta-learning insights
```
