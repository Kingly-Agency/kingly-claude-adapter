# EXPERIENCE LAYER IMPLEMENTATION SPEC

## Feature: Progressive Disclosure and Developer Experience

### **Intelligent Information Architecture**
```gherkin
Feature: Progressive disclosure of complexity based on user needs
  As a user experience system
  I want to surface relevant information at the right time
  So that users get what they need without cognitive overload

  Scenario: Simple request gets focused response
    Given user makes simple request like "/kingly help me debug this"
    When system analyzes context
    Then provide 2-3 most relevant agent recommendations
    And include 1-2 applicable patterns
    And offer simple next steps
    And include option to "show full menu" for complete options

  Scenario: Complex request gets comprehensive analysis
    Given user makes complex request like "/full analysis of our architecture"
    When system processes request
    Then provide complete multi-expert analysis
    And apply multiple relevant patterns systematically
    And offer detailed workflow recommendations
    And include confidence ratings and reasoning

  Scenario: Domain-specific requests get specialized interface
    Given user requests domain help like "/doc"
    When loading domain dashboard
    Then show only documentation-relevant agents
    And highlight writing-focused patterns
    And provide domain-specific quick actions
    And maintain connection to broader intelligence system
```

### **Contextual Intelligence Display**
```gherkin
Feature: Smart contextual recommendations based on conversation state
  As an intelligent interface
  I want to analyze conversation context and provide relevant suggestions
  So that users discover useful capabilities naturally

  Scenario: Performance discussion context
    Given conversation includes performance-related keywords
    When user requests recommendations
    Then highlight performance optimization agents
    And suggest relevant analysis patterns (noise-analysis, bottleneck identification)
    And offer performance-focused workflows
    And explain why these are recommended based on context

  Scenario: Architecture planning context
    Given conversation involves system design or architecture
    When providing recommendations
    Then prioritize architect and system design agents
    And suggest architectural validation patterns
    And offer multi-expert validation workflows
    And provide LLM-first architecture guidance

  Scenario: Documentation and writing context
    Given conversation involves writing, docs, or content
    When user seeks assistance
    Then route to documentation domain (/doc)
    And highlight content strategy and technical writing agents
    And suggest document synthesis and clarity patterns
    And offer content audit and organization workflows
```

### **Terminal and CLI Optimization**
```gherkin
Feature: CLI-optimized communication and visual design
  As a terminal interface
  I want to communicate effectively within CLI constraints
  So that information is clear, actionable, and efficiently presented

  Scenario: Concise response optimization
    Given user asks questions in CLI environment
    When generating responses
    Then keep responses to ‚â§4 lines unless detail explicitly requested
    And prioritize results over process explanations
    And prioritize actions over lengthy descriptions
    And use clear, direct language without unnecessary elaboration

  Scenario: Visual progress indication
    Given multi-step workflows are executing
    When showing progress
    Then use progress bars only for defined sequential steps
    And show current context: {project} | [üü©üü©üü©‚¨ú‚¨ú] 60% | {current step}
    And use visual indicators for different states:
      | State | Indicator | Format |
      | Working | üîÑ | {project} \| üîÑ Working \| {action} |
      | Complete | ‚úÖ | {project} \| ‚úÖ Complete \| {result} |
      | Failed | ‚ùå | {project} \| ‚ùå Failed \| {issue} |

  Scenario: Matrix hacker aesthetic maintenance
    Given visual styling needs for terminal interface
    When presenting information
    Then follow guidelines from ~/.claude/style.md
    And maintain consistent matrix hacker aesthetic
    And use appropriate visual elements for enhanced readability
    And balance style with functional clarity
```

### **Learning and Adaptation Interface**
```gherkin
Feature: Learning system interface for workflow capture and improvement
  As a learning interface
  I want to make workflow learning and improvement natural and accessible
  So that users can easily capture and reuse successful patterns

  Scenario: Automatic learning opportunity detection
    Given conversation shows successful breakthrough or effective pattern
    When user expresses satisfaction or repeats requests
    Then surface learning opportunity naturally
    And suggest pattern capture with simple confirmation
    And explain potential value of capturing this workflow
    And offer integration into personal intelligence system

  Scenario: Learning system activation
    Given user wants to formalize successful workflows
    When user types "$learn" or equivalent trigger
    Then analyze recent conversation for successful patterns
    And identify repeatable, generalizable elements
    And assess promotion potential to official system
    And provide concrete recommendations for workflow capture

  Scenario: Workflow promotion interface
    Given successful patterns are identified for promotion
    When presenting promotion opportunities
    Then explain workflow value clearly
    And show integration pathways into existing system
    And provide simple approval/rejection interface
    And handle promotion process automatically when approved
```

## Developer Experience Showcase Features

### **Natural Language Intelligence Demonstration**
```gherkin
Feature: Showcase natural language routing and intelligence
  As a demonstration system
  I want to show Kingly's natural language + structured intelligence approach
  So that users understand the power of LLM reasoning over structured knowledge

  Scenario: Natural language to structured routing
    Given user provides natural language request
    When system processes request
    Then demonstrate analysis of intent and context
    And show routing to appropriate structured intelligence
    And explain reasoning behind agent and pattern selection
    And provide confidence ratings for transparency

  Scenario: Progressive complexity handling
    Given user requests range from simple to complex
    When handling different complexity levels
    Then show system scaling intelligence appropriately
    And demonstrate progressive disclosure in action
    And show how complexity routes to appropriate expert intelligence
    And maintain consistent experience across complexity levels
