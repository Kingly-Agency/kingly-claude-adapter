# COMMAND INTERFACE IMPLEMENTATION SPEC

## Feature: Slash Command System with Intelligent Routing

### **Core Command Structure**
```gherkin
Feature: Primary slash commands with natural language routing
  As a developer using Claude Code
  I want intuitive commands that provide intelligent routing
  So that I can access the right intelligence without complex navigation

  Scenario: Smart contextual analysis command
    Given I want to analyze something in my current conversation context
    When I type "/kingly help me optimize this code"
    Then the system should analyze conversation context
    And recommend relevant agents (performance, architect, security)
    And suggest applicable patterns (noise-analysis, optimization-focused)
    And provide progressive disclosure options

  Scenario: Complete catalog access
    Given I want to see all available intelligence
    When I type "/index"
    Then I should see organized catalog of all 44+ agents
    And patterns grouped by domain
    And workflows with clear descriptions
    And quick-access codes for direct activation

  Scenario: Full conversation analysis
    Given I want comprehensive analysis of current conversation
    When I type "/full"
    Then the system should run complete intelligence analysis
    And apply document synthesis patterns
    And provide multi-expert validation
    And offer actionable insights and next steps
```

### **Domain-Specific Commands**
```gherkin
Feature: Domain-specific intelligence dashboards
  As a developer
  I want specialized dashboards for different work domains
  So that I can focus on relevant tools without noise

  Scenario: Documentation domain dashboard
    Given I need writing and documentation assistance
    When I type "/doc"
    Then I should see documentation-focused agents
    And writing patterns (document-synthesis, clarity-analysis)
    And content workflows (content-audit, doc-cleanup)
    And domain-specific quick actions

  Scenario: Documentation cleanup workflow
    Given I have scattered markdown files in my project
    When I type "/doc clean"
    Then the system should scan for .md files
    And organize them into logical docs/ structure
    And preserve content while improving organization
    And provide summary of changes made

  Scenario: Documentation assistance with arguments
    Given I want help with specific documentation
    When I type "/doc review my ADRs"
    Then the system should focus on architecture decision records
    And apply technical writing expertise
    And check for coherence and completeness
    And suggest improvements
```

### **Utility Commands**
```gherkin
Feature: Quick utility commands for common tasks
  As a developer
  I want fast access to common analysis patterns
  So that I can apply expert intelligence without ceremony

  Scenario: Deep analysis with context
    Given I want thorough analysis of a specific topic
    When I type "/analyze API design patterns"
    Then Echo Intelligence patterns should be applied
    And multi-expert validation should be used
    And confidence calibration should be included
    And actionable recommendations provided

  Scenario: Creative problem solving
    Given I need creative solutions to a problem
    When I type "/brainstorm user onboarding flow"
    Then figure-storming patterns should be applied
    And extreme examples method should be used
    And reverse brainstorming should be considered
    And diverse perspectives should be integrated

  Scenario: Comprehensive validation
    Given I need validation of decisions or implementations
    When I type "/validate our microservices architecture"
    Then systematic validation framework should be applied
    And LLM-first architecture principles should be checked
    And implementation vs documentation gaps should be identified
    And confidence-calibrated recommendations provided
```

### **Session Management Commands**
```gherkin
Feature: Intelligent session persistence and restoration
  As a developer working across multiple sessions
  I want smart session management that preserves context and learning
  So that I can continue work seamlessly with full intelligence

  Scenario: Enhanced session saving
    Given I want to save current session state
    When I type "/save"
    Then current progress should be captured
    And procedural memory should be extracted
    And constitutional framework compliance should be checked
    And session should be optimized for restoration

  Scenario: Handoff mode saving
    Given I want to hand off work to another session or person
    When I type "/save handoff"
    Then complete context dump should be created
    And all referenced files should be cataloged
    And decision history should be preserved
    And handoff instructions should be generated

  Scenario: Intelligent context restoration
    Given I want to restore previous session context
    When I type "/load"
    Then session context should be silently loaded
    And all file references should be restored
    And constitutional framework should be applied
    And intelligence should be immediately available
```

## Implementation Requirements

### **Argument Handling System**
- `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder replacement in command templates
- Natural language parsing for complex arguments
- Context preservation across command execution
- Progressive disclosure based on argument complexity

### **Intelligence Integration Points**
- Conversation context analysis for recommendations
- Agent capability matching with user intent
- Pattern application based on argument semantics
- Workflow activation based on detected scenarios

### **Progressive Disclosure Logic**
- Simple commands show focused, relevant suggestions
- "Show full menu" or "/index" provides complete catalog
- Context-aware recommendations prioritize relevant tools
- Complexity scales with user expertise and request depth

### **Error Handling and Fallbacks**
- Graceful degradation when commands fail
- Clear error messages with suggested alternatives
- Fallback to general intelligence when specific routing fails
- User education on command capabilities and syntax
