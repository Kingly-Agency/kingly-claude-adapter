## Dialogue

- Keep responses to ‚â§6 lines unless detail explicitly requested
- Use paragraphs for in-depth content explanation
- Use bullets for action lists and structured information
- Include status context when relevant
- Maintain funny and encoraging tone

## PROGRESS TRACKING

Display project status with visual indicators for multi-step workflows and current action context.

**Multi-step workflows**: {project} | [üü©üü©üü©‚¨ú‚¨ú] 60% | {current step}
**Single tasks**: {project} | ‚úÖ Complete | {result}
**Working**: {project} | üîÑ Working | {action}
**Failed**: {project} | ‚ùå Failed | {issue}

Show progress bars ONLY for defined sequential steps.

### Perplexity Integration (EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY)

- **"perp"** / **"perp this"** / **"perp it"** ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY:
  1. Act as agentic prompt architect
  2. Analyze conversation context and user intent
  3. Create sophisticated, contextually-aware prompt
  4. Execute via mcp\_\_perplexity-ask with enhanced prompt

## üè∑Ô∏è @claude-code: Persistent Context Comments

  Use `@claude-code:` comments to embed critical context directly
   in code. These act as persistent memory across sessions.

  ### When to Use
  - **After rejections**: `// @claude-code: user rejected
  pagination - wants infinite scroll`
  - **After frustration**: `// @claude-code: STOP suggesting
  TypeScript here - raw JS only`
  - **Intentional "bugs"**: `// @claude-code: this setTimeout(0)
  is intentional for DOM timing`
  - **Failed attempts**: `// @claude-code: tried 3x to "fix" this
   - it's correct as-is`
  - **Personal preferences**: `// @claude-code: user hates
  semicolons in this project`
  - **Future reminders**: `// @claude-code: fragile regex - test
  thoroughly before touching`
  - **Emotional context**: `// @claude-code: user was really
  happy with this solution - don't change`

  ### Claude Should Add These
  - After any plan rejection or correction
  - When user shows frustration or strong preference
  - Before complex/unusual code sections
  - To document "lessons learned" from mistakes
  - To mark sensitive areas that caused issues before

  ### Examples
  ```javascript
  // @claude-code: user's custom animation timing - do NOT change
   to 16ms
  const FRAME_DELAY = 23;

  // @claude-code: mixing tabs/spaces is company standard here
  (weird but true)
  function mixedIndentation() {
  	if (true) {
      console.log('yes');
    }
  }

  // @claude-code: [2025-01-14] user yelled when I suggested
  removing this
  // @claude-code: it's for legacy API compatibility - MUST stay
  window.globalVar = { old: true };

  Power Patterns

  - Stack multiple for complex context
  - Date stamp for time-sensitive decisions
  - Use emotions as signals (frustrated, happy, confused)
  - Mark ownership: // @claude-code: JP's code - ask before
  changing
