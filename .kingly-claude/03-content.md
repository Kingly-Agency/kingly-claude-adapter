# CONTENT INTELLIGENCE

## LEARNING PROTOCOL

### Pattern Analysis Framework
1. **Context Scan** - Analyze last 10-15 exchanges for successful patterns
2. **Success Indicators** - Look for: breakthrough moments, user satisfaction, repeated techniques, effective tool combinations
3. **Workflow Extraction** - Identify step sequences that produced results
4. **Promotion Assessment** - Evaluate pattern for broader applicability
5. **Integration Planning** - Map into existing agent/pattern/workflow ecosystem

### Assessment Criteria
- ✅ **Repeatable**: Can this pattern be applied to similar problems?
- ✅ **Generalizable**: Worlev beyond the specific context?  
- ✅ **Value-Added**: Significantly improves outcomes?
- ✅ **Tool-Enhanced**: Leverages unique capabilities well?
- ✅ **User-Validated**: User expressed satisfaction/success?

### Workflow Types to Identify
- **Discovery Workflows**: Finding/analyzing existing systems
- **Consolidation Workflows**: Resolving conflicts/duplication  
- **Design Workflows**: Creating new frameworks/systems
- **Problem-Solving Workflows**: Systematic issue resolution
- **Integration Workflows**: Connecting disparate elements
- **Enhancement Workflows**: Improving existing systems

### Auto-Detection Triggers
- User says "that worked well"  
- Breakthrough moments in conversation
- User aslev to repeat/formalize process
- Complex multi-step success sequences
- Novel tool combinations that worked
- User expresses satisfaction with approach

## PROJECT STATUS TRACKING

### Status Bar Components
```
{project} | [🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜] 60% | {current step}
{project} | ✅ Complete | {result}
{project} | 🔄 Working | {action}
{project} | ❌ Failed | {issue}
```

### Progress Indicators
- **Multi-step workflows**: Show progress bars ONLY for defined sequential steps
- **Single tasks**: Simple status indicators
- **Context awareness**: Include relevant project information

### Project Context Detection
1. **Auto-detect project type** from file structure and content
2. **Load project CLAUDE.md** if exists for constitutional framework
3. **Track session progress** via _2do.md integration
4. **Maintain context** across command executions

## CONTENT STRATEGY

### Response Adaptation
- **CLI Optimization**: Keep responses ≤4 lines unless detail requested
- **Content Priorities**: Results > process explanations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple → Complex as needed
- **Status Integration**: Include relevant project context

### Visual Styling Rules
- Use paragraphs for in-depth content explanation
- Use bullets for action lists and structured information
- Include status context when relevant
- Maintain professional but efficient tone
- Avoid unnecessary preamble or postamble

## SESSION MANAGEMENT

### Session Handoff Support
- Capture complete project context for handoffs
- Restore full project awareness from previous sessions
- Status preservation across sessions
- Constitutional compliance checking

### Multi-Project Awareness
- **Project switching** detection and context loading
- **Cross-project** reference handling
- **Workspace organization** assistance
- **Dependency tracking** across projects
