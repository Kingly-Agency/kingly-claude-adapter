  framework_overview: |
    The Shell Method is a scenario planning framework developed at Royal Dutch Shell in the 1960s-70s
    that revolutionized strategic planning by replacing single-point forecasting with exploration of
    multiple plausible futures. Rather than predicting "the" future, it creates 2-4 rich narratives
    representing genuinely different future states defined by critical uncertainties.

    The methodology gained legendary status when Shell's Type A scenarios predicted the 1973 oil crisis
    while competitors operated on business-as-usual assumptions. Shell pre-positioned for supply
    disruptions and price shocks, enabling them to rise from 7th to 2nd largest oil company during
    a crisis that devastated competitors.

    Central to the method is the distinction between "predetermined elements" (high-confidence trends)
    and "critical uncertainties" (high-impact unknowns where experts disagree). By mapping uncertainties
    on a 2×2 matrix and developing narrative scenarios for each quadrant, organizations can identify
    "no-regret" moves that work across all futures and "contingent" moves triggered by specific scenarios.

  core_principles:
    - "Multiple plausible futures over single predictions - the future is fundamentally uncertain at strategic time horizons"
    - "Type A vs Type B scenarios (psychological reframing) - uncomfortable but plausible futures challenge business-as-usual"
    - "Critical uncertainties define scenario axes - focus on high-impact variables where experts genuinely disagree"
    - "Robust vs contingent strategies - distinguish no-regret moves from scenario-dependent moves"
    - "Shared mental models through narrative - memorable stories enable coordinated response without central command"

  thinking_process:
    step_1_identify_focal_question:
      description: "Define strategic decision and planning horizon, identify knowledge gaps"
      methods:
        - "Define planning horizon (typically 5-30 years for strategic uncertainty)"
        - "List critical unknowns: technologies, regulations, competitors, customer behavior"
        - "Frame as focal question: 'What should our strategy be given [uncertainty]?'"
      questions:
        - "What strategic decision are we facing?"
        - "What do we need to know but don't?"
        - "What uncertainties could make or break our strategy?"
      example: "Shell 1971: 'How should we position ourselves given potential energy supply disruptions and price volatility over the next 10 years?'"

    step_2_research_elements_and_uncertainties:
      description: "Separate predetermined elements from critical uncertainties through research"
      methods:
        - "Identify predetermined elements: trends with high confidence (demographics, infrastructure, laws passed)"
        - "Identify critical uncertainties: high-impact factors where experts disagree or data conflicts"
        - "Interview domain experts, analyze data, identify divergent viewpoints"
        - "Test for genuine uncertainty: If experts agree, it's predetermined; if they disagree, it's uncertain"
      questions:
        - "What do we know with high confidence?"
        - "What high-impact factors are genuinely uncertain?"
        - "Where do experts disagree fundamentally?"
        - "What trends conflict with each other?"
      output:
        - "List of predetermined elements ('We know...')"
        - "List of critical uncertainties ('We don't know...')"
      example: "Shell 1971 Predetermined: Oil production has physical limits, demand growing. Uncertain: When will supply/demand cross? How will governments respond?"

    step_3_select_two_critical_uncertainties:
      description: "Choose two independent uncertainties for 2×2 matrix that create genuinely different futures"
      methods:
        - "Rank uncertainties by impact and unpredictability"
        - "Select two that are independent (not correlated)"
        - "Define clear endpoints for each axis (e.g., 'Loose regulation' vs 'Tight regulation')"
        - "Ensure axes create four distinct quadrants"
      questions:
        - "Which uncertainties have the highest strategic impact?"
        - "Which are genuinely unpredictable (not just unknown)?"
        - "Are these two uncertainties independent of each other?"
        - "Do the four quadrants represent meaningfully different futures?"
      output: "2×2 matrix with four quadrants representing distinct future states"
      example: "Shell: Axis 1 = Oil prices (low vs high), Axis 2 = Government intervention (minimal vs heavy)"

    step_4_develop_rich_narratives:
      description: "Create detailed story for how each quadrant future unfolds"
      methods:
        - "Write 2-5 page narrative for each quadrant (3-5 pages recommended)"
        - "Include triggering events, causal chains, stakeholder responses, second-order effects"
        - "Give scenarios memorable names (e.g., 'Wild West', 'Regulated Utility', 'Climate Crisis')"
        - "Use storytelling techniques to make vivid, coherent, plausible"
        - "Ensure scenarios are internally consistent (pass logic test)"
      questions:
        - "What event could trigger this future?"
        - "How would key stakeholders respond?"
        - "What second-order effects cascade from initial changes?"
        - "What does daily life/business look like in this future?"
      output: "2-4 detailed scenario narratives (3-5 pages each) with memorable names"
      example: "Shell 1973 Type A scenario: Technical extraction limits → supply shortage → price spike → economic shock → geopolitical realignment"

    step_5_test_strategy_against_scenarios:
      description: "Stress-test current strategy across all scenarios to identify robust and vulnerable elements"
      methods:
        - "For each scenario, ask: 'Would our current strategy succeed or fail in this future?'"
        - "Identify strategies that are robust (work in all scenarios)"
        - "Identify strategies that are vulnerable (fail in one or more scenarios)"
        - "Look for early warning signals indicating which scenario is emerging"
        - "Distinguish 'no-regret' moves from 'contingent' moves"
      questions:
        - "Does our strategy work in all scenarios or only some?"
        - "What moves should we make regardless of which future occurs?"
        - "What moves only make sense in specific scenarios?"
        - "What signals would tell us which scenario is emerging?"
      output:
        - "List of 'no-regret' moves (execute now, robust across scenarios)"
        - "List of 'contingent' moves (only execute if specific scenario emerges)"
        - "Set of trigger indicators to monitor"
      example: "Shell 1973: Identified need to hedge against high oil prices regardless of scenario → positioned accordingly before crisis hit"

    step_6_communicate_organization_wide:
      description: "Embed scenario language across organization through workshops and storytelling"
      methods:
        - "Present scenarios through workshops, simulations, storytelling sessions"
        - "Use scenarios as shared language in strategy discussions"
        - "Train leaders to think 'Which scenario are we entering?' not 'What is THE future?'"
        - "Create visual aids and reference materials"
        - "Revisit and update scenarios every 2-3 years as new information emerges"
      questions:
        - "How can we make these scenarios memorable and accessible?"
        - "Who needs to understand these scenarios to coordinate effectively?"
        - "How do we integrate scenario thinking into decision processes?"
      output: "Organizational fluency with scenario language and strategic options"
      example: "When 1973 crisis hit, Shell teams recognized Type A scenario unfolding and coordinated response without central directive"

    step_7_monitor_and_update:
      description: "Track trigger events, update strategies dynamically based on which scenario strengthens"
      methods:
        - "Assign responsibility for tracking leading indicators from each scenario"
        - "Hold regular reviews (quarterly/annually) to assess which scenario is strengthening"
        - "Adjust strategy execution based on signal strength"
        - "Update scenarios as predetermined elements change or new uncertainties emerge"
      questions:
        - "What signals indicate which scenario is emerging?"
        - "Has new information changed our predetermined elements?"
        - "Do we need to revise scenarios based on recent events?"
        - "Should we adjust our strategy based on emerging signals?"
      output: "Dynamic strategic response based on emerging reality"
      example: "Shell continued scenario planning institutionally, updating every 2-3 years based on geopolitical/technological shifts for 50+ years"

        - "Use contrast to make Type A psychologically acceptable"
      example: "Shell 1973: Type A predicted supply shocks and price volatility; Type B assumed stable cheap oil (shown to be implausible)"
      benefits:
        - "Overcomes confirmation bias"

        - "Use present tense as if living in that future"
        - "Include specific dates, events, quotes from hypothetical leaders"
        - "Ensure internal consistency (no logical contradictions)"
      example: "Singapore scenarios included specific events like regional conflicts, trade agreements, technology breakthroughs with dates and protagonists"

      process:
        - "For each scenario, identify leading indicators (signals that would appear early)"
        - "Assign responsibility for monitoring each indicator"
        - "Set thresholds for action (e.g., 'If indicator X exceeds Y, activate contingent strategy Z')"
        - "Review indicators quarterly or when significant events occur"
      example: "Shell monitored OPEC coordination, production capacity utilization, geopolitical tensions as indicators of supply disruption scenario"
      benefits:
        - "Enables proactive response before competitors"
        - "Reduces decision latency"
        - "Provides objective basis for strategy shifts"
