# /brainstorm — Superpowers Brainstorming

1. If the unified skills CLI is available, run `~/.claude/skills/bin/skills onboarding` to load governance and skill index. Otherwise, review the onboarding block in the system prompt.
2. Use the Read tool on `${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/collaboration/brainstorming/SKILL.md` before proceeding. Do not rely on prior knowledge.
3. Announce: "I'm using the Brainstorming skill to refine this idea into a design."
4. Follow the skill exactly—one question at a time in Phase 1, explore 2-3 approaches, then present the design incrementally with validations.
5. When design is approved and implementation will follow, hand off to `/write-plan`.
