## ðŸ§ª EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES

### Cross-Workspace Intelligence Extension
Advanced multi-workspace capabilities for portfolio-level intelligence and cross-project pattern analysis.

**Semantic Detection Patterns:**
â–º "across projects" / "all workspaces" â†’ Multi-workspace intelligence activation
â–º "mcp-ceo and aiforge" â†’ Specific workspace coordination protocols  
â–º "compare kingly vs p25 approaches" â†’ Cross-project analysis workflows
â–º "portfolio view" â†’ Enterprise intelligence across all active projects

**Enhanced Routing Examples:**
```
User: "Analyze authentication patterns across aiforge and p25"
â†’ Agent Selection: Development Engineer:architect (1i) + cross-context-learning (3b)
â†’ Workspace Context: ["aiforge", "p25"] 
â†’ Focus: "authentication patterns"
â†’ Cross-workspace workflow activated
```

**Integration with Kingly Workflows:**
â–º **cross-context-learning (3b)**: Cross-workspace pattern detection and analysis
â–º **insight-bubbling (3f)**: Multi-project insight propagation across workspaces  
â–º **knowledge-trickling (3g)**: Workspace-to-workspace knowledge transfer protocols
â–º **multi-expert-validation (3h)**: Portfolio-level strategic analysis and validation

### Natural Language Intelligence (Contextual Routing)
Experimental automatic agent routing based on conversational context and user intent detection.

When user describes needs in natural language, automatically analyze conversation context and technical domain, detect user intent (help, analyze, compare, debug), generate contextual menu of relevant options, and let user choose or describe different approach.

**Example Interactions:**
```
User: "help with authentication patterns"
â†’ Contextual Analysis: Security + architecture + current project context
â†’ Generated Menu Options:
   1) Development Engineer:security - Authentication implementation focus
   2) Development Engineer:architect - System design perspective  
   3) Decision-matrix pattern - Compare authentication approaches
   4) Cross-workspace analysis - Check auth patterns in other projects
   5) Something else? (describe your specific need)
```

```
User: "this performance is terrible"
â†’ Contextual Analysis: Performance + frustration indicator + debugging context
â†’ Generated Menu Options:
   1) Development Engineer:frontend - UI optimization specialist
   2) Development Engineer:debugger - Problem diagnosis expert
   3) Rice-scoring pattern - Prioritize performance improvement tasks
   4) Something else? (describe the specific performance issue)
```

### Automatic Workflow Detection
Experimental protocols for detecting workflow patterns and automatically bubbling insights between contexts.

**Workflow Bubbling Insights:**
â–º Detect significant insights from nested contexts and propagate upward
â–º Share relevant parent insights with child contexts automatically
â–º Enable portfolio intelligence through workflow-driven context connections
â–º Implement dynamic routing based on system entropy for stability vs innovation balance

**Insight Detection Patterns:**
â–º Monitor for breakthrough moments in problem-solving workflows
â–º Identify reusable patterns across different project contexts  
â–º Track decision points that could benefit other workspace contexts
â–º Flag architectural insights for cross-project application

### Time Estimation Adjustments
Experimental calibration system for more realistic development time estimates in AI-assisted workflows.

**Traditional vs AI-Assisted Reality:**
â–º Traditional dev time estimation / 10 = realistic with AI assistance baseline
â–º 3-week traditional projects = 1-2 days with agents and kingly processes
â–º Account for claude code, remote agents, and specialized kingly workflows
â–º Factor in context switching overhead and learning curve adjustments

**Estimation Factors:**
â–º AI pair programming acceleration multipliers
â–º Context loading and setup time considerations
â–º Debugging and iteration cycle improvements with AI assistance
â–º Integration complexity with existing systems and workflows

### Terminal Styling Experiments
Advanced terminal presentation features for enhanced developer experience and visual workflow clarity.

**BBS-Style Terminal Enhancements:**
â–º Advanced ASCII art integration for project branding and status
â–º Dynamic terminal themes based on project context and current workflow
â–º Enhanced progress indicators with terminal animations and transitions
â–º Context-aware color schemes that adapt to current development phase

**Development Workflow Integration:**
â–º Project identification through terminal styling and status indicators
â–º Multi-tab workspace awareness with visual project differentiation
â–º Automatic terminal theme switching based on active project context
â–º Enhanced status bars showing git branch, project health, and workflow state

**Process Management:**
â–º Automatic orphaned process detection and cleanup protocols
â–º Development server management with proper lifecycle handling
â–º Background task monitoring and status reporting integration
â–º Terminal session persistence across context switches and workflow changes
