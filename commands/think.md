Intelligent Situational Analysis

1. **Analyze Current Situation** from conversation context
2. **Execute Enhanced Context Discovery:**

lets work through these steps/questions/information 1 by 1.

display pros/cons, tradeoffs, 1 quesion at a time interview style.

frameworks to select from:
perform scamper, swot, extreme + reverse brainstorming, figure storming, all known biz and ux frameworks, first principles, systems thinking.
provide all TCM/Chinese/african/hindi/eastern philosphy matrices and some religious poetry for inspiration that is spiritually related in any quantum sense

synthesize analysis from each framework above using MBTI personality types so we can look at it from 8 perspectives.

from the above framework, choose 1-n, [all] if the context is complex, algorithmically reducing # of frameworks considered as context gets simpler. also be sure to select frameworks deemed most beneficial for the topic at hand. e.g. coding tasks typically benefit from systems thinking.

give me 1-n lists of recommendations to choose from and help me think

Followup/Progression Template:
1- [Recommend choice]
2- [Creative choice]
3- [Unconventional choice]
4- [Series of follow up options]
5- [Tangentially related]
#- [Etc... etc... etc..]
#- [Continue to next topic]
#- [Go back to previous topic]

The follow up template is where the magic happens. 1-10 (max) suggestions that provide MAX value. The last 3 options should be ALL, continue and back.

3. **Situational Intelligence Response:**

```
🧠 **Situation Detected:** [analyzed situation type]

**Recommended Approach:** [best-fit context combination]
- Primary: [main-context] - [description] ([effectiveness]%)
- Supporting: [support-context] - [description] ([effectiveness]%)
- Process: [workflow sequence in plain language]

**Why This Approach:**
[reasoning based on detected situation characteristics]

**Flow Options:**
• Execute recommended approach
• "/research [topic]" for deeper analysis
• "/checkpoint" to save this thinking
• "combine [contexts]" for custom approach
```

4. **Auto-save Structured Thinking:**
   - Save to ~/.claude/drafts/think-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md
   - Include full context analysis and reasoning
   - Provide checkpoint integration for session continuity
