# PERPLEXITY ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM

## ðŸŽ¯ ENHANCEMENT TECHNIQUES

### **Context-Aware Prompt Architecture**
Transform simple queries into sophisticated, contextually-rich prompts for maximum insight generation.

**Enhancement Strategies:**
1. **Domain Expertise Injection** - Add relevant expert perspectives
2. **Multi-Angle Analysis** - Request multiple viewpoints and approaches  
3. **Constraint Integration** - Include specific parameters and limitations
4. **Output Structuring** - Define clear format and organization requirements
5. **Depth Calibration** - Adjust technical depth based on context
6. **Source Prioritization** - Guide toward authoritative and recent sources

### **Prompt Enhancement Patterns**

#### **Research Enhancement**
```
You are [relevant expert type] analyzing [specific domain].
Provide a comprehensive analysis of [query] that includes:
1. Current state assessment with recent developments
2. Multiple expert perspectives and methodologies
3. Practical implications and real-world applications
4. Potential challenges and limitations
5. Future directions and emerging trends

Focus on authoritative sources from [timeframe] and prioritize [specific criteria].
Structure your response with clear sections and actionable insights.
```

#### **Technical Analysis Enhancement**
```
As a [technical expert] with expertise in [domain], analyze [topic] with focus on:
- Technical specifications and requirements
- Implementation considerations and best practices
- Performance implications and optimization strategies
- Compatibility and integration challenges
- Cost-benefit analysis and ROI considerations

Provide concrete examples and cite specific sources where possible.
```

#### **Strategic Decision Enhancement**
```
From a strategic planning perspective, evaluate [decision/option] considering:
- Market dynamics and competitive landscape
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Resource requirements and constraints
- Timeline and implementation phases
- Success metrics and KPIs

Include both quantitative data and qualitative insights.
