# Claude Code Commands - Flow-Based Intelligence System

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Philosophy: LLM-First, Zero Cognitive Load

These commands create intelligent flow-based interactions where Claude extracts context and provides options rather than requiring specific command syntax knowledge.

## ðŸš€ Primary Commands

### `/kingly` - Context-Aware Intelligence Translator
**Usage:** Just type `/kingly` 
- Extracts context from recent conversation
- Returns ALL relevant contexts with confidence scores
- Provides flow-based selection options
- Integrates with enhanced semantic search (73+ contexts)

### `/checkpoint` - Unified Session Management  
**Modes:**
- `/checkpoint` - Mark progress during active work
- `/checkpoint --resume` - Continue previous session
- `/checkpoint --new` - Start fresh work session  
- `/checkpoint --final` - Create comprehensive rollup

### `/research` - Enhanced Research System
**Usage:** `/research [topic]`
- Auto-detects research type from context
- Enhances queries with domain expertise
- Integrates findings with available contexts
- Connects to checkpoint system for continuity

### `/think` - Intelligent Situational Analysis
**Usage:** `/think [optional topic]`
- Analyzes current situation from context
- Recommends approach with effectiveness ratings
- Auto-saves structured thinking to drafts
- Provides flow options for next steps

### `/go` - Execute Next Action
**Usage:** `/go`
- Takes immediate action based on current context
- Identifies most logical next step
- Executes and reports results
- Maintains momentum in flow state

## ðŸ”§ Support Commands

- `/debug` - 95% confidence validation framework
- `/audit` - Comprehensive system analysis with performance tracking  
- `/load` - Initialize intelligence modules
- `/all` - Comprehensive context analysis
- `/doc`, `/exec`, `/learn`, `/save` - Specialized utilities

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Slug-based contexts** - Memorable names (systematic-creativity vs 1a)
- **Rich YAML embeddings** - Enhanced semantic search
- **Flow-based selection** - Natural language options
- **Session continuity** - Persistent context across sessions
- **@claude-code comments** - Persistent LLM memory in source
- **Self-healing guidance** - Intelligent error recovery

## ðŸŽ¨ DX Vision

Commands that make Claude **smarter about your intent** instead of making you **smarter about command syntax**. Pure conversational intelligence that adapts to your flow state.
