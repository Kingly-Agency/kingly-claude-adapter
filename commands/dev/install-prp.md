Your goal is to import into this project the PRP supporting docs and templates from the user's root Claude Code folder.

## Framework details

PRP framework location base folder:
`~/.claude/vendor/PRPs-agentic-eng/`

PRP framework templates:
`~/.claude/vendor/PRPs-agentic-eng/PRPs/*`

We are not concerned with anything else in the vendor folder.

## Order of operations

1- Immediately proceed with the scanning phase
2- List the deltas of what will be imported and wait for user feedback. Make sure to use the follow up template so they can quickly choose common options
3- After validating the user wants to continue, pay attention to their feedback about what to import and execute the import phase.

## Scanning phase

1 - Scan the location above using `tree` for a quick overview of available files
2 - Determine the type of project based on a CLAUDE.md or if not available do a `tree` and assess
3 - Check if the working directory has a `PRPs/` folder
4 - If it does, check that `PRPs/templates`, and `PRPs/ai_docs` have the correct template structure, files, and documentation

## Phase response template

After completing the scanning phase, use this template for user feedback:
