## ENHANCED RESEARCH OPERATIONS

### **1. Multi-Source Research Coordination**
```bash
# Web research with constitutional analysis
/lev/research "AI workflow orchestration platforms"
‚Üí Perplexity research + repository analysis + constitutional assessment

# Competitive intelligence with integration focus  
/lev/research competitors "temporal workflow orchestration"
‚Üí Systematic competitor analysis + LLM-first compliance evaluation

# Technology deep-dive with synthesis
/lev/research technology "vector databases for LLM applications"
‚Üí Technical analysis + integration opportunities + strategic recommendations
```

### **2. Constitutional Research Framework**
All research automatically filtered through constitutional principles:

- **Cortisol Reduction**: Does this reduce complexity and cognitive load?
- **Bootstrap Sovereignty**: Can this work with minimal external dependencies?
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Does this reveal complexity appropriately?
- **Recursive Excellence**: Will this improve with continued use?
- **Economic Empowerment**: Does this create value and opportunities?
- **Multi-Verse Scaling**: Can this scale from personal to planetary coordination?

### **3. 8-Personality Research Analysis**
Research findings evaluated through EEPS personality framework:

**Yin Personalities (Risk Assessment)**:
- **SFJ Caregiver**: Impact on stress and user experience
- **STJ Leader**: Structural implications and governance
- **SFP Connector**: Community and relationship effects
- **STP Adapter**: Practical implementation considerations

**Yang Personalities (Opportunity Assessment)**:
- **NFP Advocate**: Values alignment and ethical implications
- **NTP Innovator**: Innovation potential and creative applications
- **NFJ Visionary**: Future possibilities and strategic vision
- **NTJ Strategist**: Power dynamics and competitive advantages
