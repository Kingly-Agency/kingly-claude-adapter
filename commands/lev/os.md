# /lev/os - Leviathan Operating System Command Router

## MISSION: AI Operating System for Intelligent Command Orchestration

When user says "/lev/os":

1. **Analyze User Intent & Context**
   - Parse user request for operation type
   - Identify required Leviathan subsystems
   - Determine complexity and multi-step requirements
   - Extract domain context (workshop, memory, constitutional, etc.)

2. **Intelligent Command Routing**
   ```
   ðŸ¤– **Leviathan OS** - Routing your request...
   
   **Detected Intent**: [workshop intake / memory operation / research / workflow execution]
   **Target Subsystem**: [workshop / memory / constitutional / research]
   **Complexity**: [simple / multi-step / orchestrated]
   **Context Required**: [minimal / moderate / comprehensive]
   ```

3. **Pre-Load Required Context**
   - **Workshop Operations**: Load tier classification, intake patterns
   - **Memory Operations**: Load hybrid memory architecture, backend options
   - **Constitutional AI**: Load bidirectional flow, personality system
   - **Research Operations**: Load enhanced research patterns
   - **Plugin Management**: Load plugin architecture, core boundaries

4. **Route to Appropriate Subsystem**
   ```bash
   # Workshop Intake
   /lev/os intake https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra
   â†’ Routes to /lev/intake with workshop context pre-loaded
   
   # Memory Operations  
   /lev/os memory switch-backend graphiti
   â†’ Routes to /lev/memory with memory architecture context
   
   # Research Operations
   /lev/os research "AI workflow orchestration platforms"
   â†’ Routes to /lev/research with enhanced research context
   
   # Find Operations
   /lev/os find "bidirectional flow patterns"
   â†’ Routes to /lev/find with semantic search context
   ```

5. **Multi-Step Orchestration**
   ```
   ðŸ’¡ **Orchestrated Operations**:
   
   /lev/os "analyze mastra and compare to kingly architecture"
   â†’ 1. Workshop intake of Mastra repository
   â†’ 2. Load Kingly architectural context  
   â†’ 3. Comparative analysis using constitutional framework
   â†’ 4. Strategic integration recommendations
   
   /lev/os "research and intake competitive AI frameworks"
   â†’ 1. Research AI workflow platforms
   â†’ 2. Intake top 3 repositories
   â†’ 3. Workshop classification and analysis
   â†’ 4. Integration opportunity assessment
   ```

6. **Command Discovery & Help**
   ```
   ðŸ“‹ **Available Leviathan Commands**:
   
   /lev/find       - Semantic context discovery
   /lev/intake     - Workshop repository analysis  
   /lev/memory     - Memory system operations
   /lev/research   - Enhanced research operations
   /lev/workflow   - Constitutional AI workflows
   /lev/all        - Full system capabilities
   /lev/help       - Command documentation
   
   ðŸ’¡ **Smart Routing Examples**:
   â€¢ "intake this repo" â†’ /lev/intake
   â€¢ "research topic" â†’ /lev/research  
   â€¢ "find patterns" â†’ /lev/find
   â€¢ "memory status" â†’ /lev/memory
   ```

## Key Features:

- **Intent Analysis**: Understands natural language requests
- **Smart Routing**: Directs to appropriate Leviathan subsystem
- **Context Pre-loading**: Loads only necessary context for operation
- **Multi-step Orchestration**: Handles complex workflows automatically
- **Command Discovery**: Helps users discover system capabilities
- **Zero Friction**: No manual context explanation required

## Example Executions:

### Workshop Intake
```
User: "/lev/os intake https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra"

Leviathan OS: 
ðŸ¤– **Routing to Workshop Intake**
- Pre-loading workshop intelligence context
- Loading tier classification system  
- Preparing LLM-first repository analysis

â†’ Executing comprehensive Mastra repository intake...
```

### Research & Analysis
```
User: "/lev/os research competitive AI workflow platforms"

Leviathan OS:
ðŸ¤– **Routing to Enhanced Research**  
- Pre-loading research patterns
- Preparing multi-source coordination
- Loading synthesis frameworks

â†’ Executing comprehensive competitive analysis...
```

### Multi-step Orchestration
```
User: "/lev/os analyze and compare mastra to our architecture"

Leviathan OS:
ðŸ¤– **Orchestrating Multi-step Analysis**
Step 1: Workshop intake of Mastra â†’ /lev/intake
Step 2: Load Kingly architecture context â†’ /lev/find
Step 3: Constitutional analysis â†’ /lev/workflow  
Step 4: Integration recommendations â†’ /lev/research

â†’ Executing orchestrated workflow...
```

**Strategy**: Serve as the intelligent operating system that eliminates friction between user intent and Leviathan's sophisticated capabilities, providing zero-context-explanation access to all system functionality.
