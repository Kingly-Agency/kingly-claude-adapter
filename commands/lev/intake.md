# /lev/intake - Workshop Repository Intake Automation

## MISSION: Automated LLM-First Repository Analysis with Zero Context Explanation

When user says "/lev/intake":

## PRE-LOADED CONTEXT: Workshop Intelligence System

**8-Tier Semantic Classification:**
- **Tier 1 (PRODUCTION-READY)**: Battle-tested, immediate integration (1-2 weeks)
- **Tier 2 (ADVANCED-STABLE)**: Proven architecture requiring adaptation (2-4 weeks)  
- **Tier 3 (EMERGING-VIABLE)**: Solid foundation with growing adoption (3-6 weeks)
- **Tier 4 (RESEARCH-READY)**: Interesting approach with limited production usage (4-8 weeks)
- **Tier 5 (EXPERIMENTAL-PROMISING)**: Novel approach in early adoption (6-12 weeks)
- **Tier 6 (PROTOTYPE-STAGE)**: Working proof-of-concept requiring refinement (8-16 weeks)
- **Tier 7 (CONCEPT-PROOF)**: Academic implementation for pattern extraction (12+ weeks)
- **Tier 8 (EXPLORATORY)**: Early ideas for concept evaluation only (research only)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **LLM-First Compliance (40% weight)**: Built with LLM reasoning as core architecture
- **Sovereignty Alignment (30% weight)**: Self-contained with minimal external dependencies
- **Integration Complexity (20% weight)**: Development effort required for integration
- **Strategic Value (10% weight)**: Business impact and competitive advantage potential

**Decision Matrix:**
- **Adopt Immediately**: weighted_score ‚â• 0.8 AND llm_first_compliance ‚â• 0.8
- **Adapt and Integrate**: weighted_score ‚â• 0.6 AND strategic_value ‚â• 0.6
- **Research Evaluation**: weighted_score ‚â• 0.4 OR strategic_value ‚â• 0.8
- **Pattern Extraction**: strategic_value ‚â• 0.6 AND integration_complexity < 0.4
- **Reject/Monitor**: weighted_score < 0.4 AND llm_first_compliance < 0.4

## AUTOMATED INTAKE PROCESS

1. **Repository Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Clone repository for analysis
   git clone <repository_url> ~/lev/workshop/intake/<repo_name>
   
   # Execute LLM-first analysis
   node ~/lev/plugins/@lev/workshop/src/commands/intake.js <repo_path>
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**
   - **Project Overview**: Technology stack, purpose, architecture patterns
   - **Strategic Assessment**: Value proposition and market positioning
   - **LLM-First Alignment**: Evaluation against true LLM-first principles
   - **Integration Opportunities**: Compatibility with Kingly ecosystem
   - **Quick Decision**: Immediate strategic recommendation

3. **Constitutional Compliance Check**
   - **Cortisol Reduction**: Does this reduce complexity and stress?
   - **Bootstrap Sovereignty**: Can this work with minimal dependencies?
   - **Progressive Disclosure**: Does this reveal complexity appropriately?
   - **Recursive Excellence**: Will this improve with use?
   - **Economic Empowerment**: Does this create value and opportunity?

4. **Kingly Architecture Compatibility**
   - **Bidirectional Flow**: Can this support LLM‚ÜîLLM conversations?
   - **Constitutional Framework**: Is this compatible with values-based decisions?
   - **8-Personality EEPS**: Can this work with personality switching?
   - **Semantic Discovery**: Does this support natural language workflows?
   - **Plugin Architecture**: How does this integrate with existing plugins?

## INTEGRATION WITH KINGLY ECOSYSTEM

**Memory System Enhancement**:
- Compare against @lev-os/memory hybrid architecture
- Evaluate backend compatibility (Graphiti, file system)
- Assess memory type coverage (procedural, semantic, temporal, working, episodic)

**Plugin Architecture Compatibility**:
- Evaluate against core/plugin boundary decisions
- Assess namespace organization (@lev-os, @lev, @homie)
- Check MCP integration capabilities

**Constitutional AI Integration**:
- Test against bidirectional flow requirements
- Evaluate personality system compatibility
- Check values-based decision making support

## USAGE EXAMPLES

```bash
# Single repository intake
/lev/intake https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra

# Batch intake for competitive analysis
/lev/intake https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain
/lev/intake https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index  
/lev/intake https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI
