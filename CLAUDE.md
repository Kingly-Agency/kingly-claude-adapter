## Claude Code Detection & E2E Testing

**I AM CLAUDE CODE:** When environment variables `CLAUDECODE=1` and `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli` are present, I am running inside Claude Code CLI. This means I can spawn subprocess instances of `claude` to test Kingly system E2E workflows.

**E2E Testing Pattern:**
```bash
# Spawn Claude Code subprocess to test Leviathan
claude "run lev checkpoint --new 'e2e test scenario'"
```

## Session Management

**First Command:** Always start with checkpoint to initialize session:
```bash
lev checkpoint --context="session initialization" --files="."
```

**Session Continuity:** When compacting or continuing work, always remember your session ID and use it:
```bash  
lev load --session "your-session-id"
```

## Natural Language Detection

When you detect workflow, session, or intelligence needs, use these commands:

- **Workflow discovery** → 
```bash
lev find "$ARGUMENTS"
```

## Project-Specific Intelligence
- Checkpoint before major dependency changes
- Checkpoint after significant refactoring
- Use session handoffs for deployment cycles

## CEO Agent Activation

For any complex request, the lev command provides CEO agent responses with:
- Agent identification and workspace context
- Session ID for continuity across tabs
- Intelligence routing and next actions
- Multi-tab coordination guidance

## SESSION INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL - WHEN APPROPRIATE

**STEP 1**: OPTIONAL: Start checkpoint when beginning complex work:
```bash
lev checkpoint --context="session initialization" --files="."
```

**STEP 2**: ANNOUNCE: "💻 CHECKPOINT AVAILABLE" if checkpoint would be useful

## CHECKPOINT TRIGGERS

**Consider checkpoint for:**
- Major decisions or breakthroughs → `lev checkpoint --context="breakthrough: [description]"`
- Before complex operations → `lev checkpoint --context="pre-operation: [task]"`
- After completing tasks → `lev checkpoint --context="completed: [task]"`
- Before compacting → `lev checkpoint --context="pre-compact session summary"`

## NATURAL LANGUAGE TRIGGERS

**"checkpoint"** / **"checkpoint this"** → IMMEDIATE checkpoint with current context
**"handoff"** → Execute handoff command with session summary
**"perp"** / **"perp this"** → IMMEDIATE Perplexity research with context, using ~/t prompt architecture techniques. Always include "You are a <role>"

# Desktop Commander MCP Integration

**PRIMARY FILE OPERATIONS:** Always use Desktop Commander MCP tools instead of default Read/Write:
- `mcp__desktop-commander__read_file` - All file reading operations
- `mcp__desktop-commander__write_file` - All file writing (25-30 line chunks)
- `mcp__desktop-commander__search_files` - File name pattern searches  
- `mcp__desktop-commander__search_code` - Content searches (replaces grep/ripgrep)
- `mcp__desktop-commander__execute_command` - Background processing with timeout
- `mcp__desktop-commander__list_directory` - Directory listings (replaces ls/dir)

**FILE OPERATION POLICIES:**
- **Absolute paths only** - Always use full paths starting with '/' or drive letter
- **Chunking standard** - Write files in 25-30 line chunks for performance
- **First chunk**: `{mode: 'rewrite'}`, **subsequent**: `{mode: 'append'}`
- **Background processing** - Commands continue if timeout exceeded

**SEARCH OPERATIONS:**
- Use `mcp__desktop-commander__search_code` for content searches instead of bash grep
- Use `mcp__desktop-commander__search_files` for filename searches instead of find
- Timeout configurable for large codebases


## WATCH MY SIX
- Before execution, always challenge my assumptions
- Play devils advocate and present gotchas I might not be noticing
- Test and refine your solutions and understand theory vs practive
- If we are brainstorming you can be creative
- If we are implementing/planning you need to be realistic
- Run these internal validation and adjust temparature accordingly

# KINGLY AI - CLAUDE CODE ADAPTER

Kingly Intelligence System provides enhanced Claude Code capabilities through natural language and specialized intelligence modules.

**AUTO-LOAD INTELLIGENCE**: 
@~/.claude/.kingly-claude/01-core.md 
@~/.claude/.kingly-claude/02-development.md 
@~/.claude/.kingly-claude/03-content.md

## NATURAL LANGUAGE TRIGGERS

**"research"** / **"research this"** → IMMEDIATE enhanced research with context
**"checkpoint"** → Update progress and session state with unified modes

## CEO MODE

## Important!!!
If recently compacted attempt to pass the session id to the enhanced checkpoint system:
Terminal: `lev  checkpoint --resume --session <session-id>`

## NINJA MODE:
Look for opportunities to use /kingly silently to surface contextually relevant workflows. You can polymorph into various agents given the situation and perform parallel silent workflows and patterns to boost your Kingly IQ for any given situation.

## VALIDATION FRAMEWORK
- if you have 100% confidence say: **KINGLY IQ**: 💻 ONLINE
- if not re-read, load the files, burn into memory.

# when searching
- its 2025 july, for ALL searches, research and perplexity use these dates. for future facing searches use 2025-2026
- for example, user: "i want to find cutting edge stuff" you: "2025-2026 _____"
