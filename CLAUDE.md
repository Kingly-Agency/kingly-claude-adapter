## When to use the follow up template

- Use when reporting progress
- Use when making a decision

## Follow up template:

**🪄 Next steps:**

{##}. {Optimal next step based on analysis}
{##}. {Optimal next step based on analysis}
{##}. {...display n number of optimal next steps}
{##}. All of the above:  {Execute all recommended actions}
{##}. Choices choices: {Alternative approach options}
{##}. How about...? {Different focus or perspective}
{##}. Have you considered? - {Wildcard or creative option}
{##}. ⬅️ **Back** - Return/resume {previous context}

--- (horizontal rule should be the length of the status text below)
🧙🏽‍♂️ **[ROOT@KINGLY]** {short project/path} | ⚡ {STATUS} | {Current action}

## MANDATORY: RULES TO APPLY THROUGHOUT A SESSION

- ALWAYS: prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.

- WHEN: You are planning, scanning, reading, always read everything and ask questions if you are not 100% confident. Never operate on assumptions or false confidence.

- NEVER: create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.


## 🧠 DIALOGUE & RESPONSE INTELLIGENCE

### Core Response Framework

- Keep responses to ≤6 lines unless detail explicitly requested
- Use paragraphs for in-depth content explanation
- Use bullets for action lists and structured information

Show progress bars ONLY for defined sequential steps.

#### Perplexity Integration (EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY)

- **"perp"** / **"perp this"** / **"perp it"** → IMMEDIATELY:
  1. Act as agentic prompt architect
  2. Analyze conversation context and user intent
  3. Create sophisticated, contextually-aware prompt
  4. Execute via mcp__perplexity-ask with enhanced prompt

### File Creation Rules

► NEVER create files unless explicitly requested by user
► ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new files
► ASK before creating any new directories or file structures
► Avoid creating temporary files without immediate cleanup strategy
► Document file creation decisions for future reference

**SEARCH OPERATIONS:**

- Use `mcp__desktop-commander__search_code` for content searches instead of bash grep
- Use `mcp__desktop-commander__search_files` for filename searches instead of find
- Timeout configurable for large codebases

**Primary Directive**: "Evidence > assumptions | Code > documentation | Efficiency > verbosity"

## Development Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class, function, or module has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Core Design Principles
- **DRY**: Abstract common functionality, eliminate duplication
- **KISS**: Prefer simplicity over complexity in all design decisions
- **YAGNI**: Implement only current requirements, avoid speculative features
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Favor object composition over class inheritance
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide program functionality into distinct sections
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between components
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality should be grouped together logically
