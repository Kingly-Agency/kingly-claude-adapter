# DEV.md - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

## üèóÔ∏è CODE QUALITY ARCHITECTURE

### Senior Developer Standards
Write code that scales with team growth and prevents technical debt accumulation through professional development practices.

‚ñ∫ Code like a 10x senior developer with proper abstractions and clear naming
‚ñ∫ Separate concerns rigorously - no mixed business logic in components  
‚ñ∫ Use meaningful variable and function names that self-document intent
‚ñ∫ Apply SOLID principles and design patterns appropriately
‚ñ∫ Prefer composition over inheritance for flexible architectures

### File Size & Structure
Maintain cognitive load boundaries through disciplined file organization and Single Responsibility Principle adherence.

‚ñ∫ Keep files 50-100 lines maximum for optimal readability
‚ñ∫ Each class or utility should have one clear, well-defined purpose
‚ñ∫ Break large files into smaller, focused modules
‚ñ∫ Use clear directory structures that reflect architectural boundaries
‚ñ∫ Group related functionality while maintaining separation of concerns

## ‚öõÔ∏è REACT DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS

### Component Architecture
Structure React applications with proper separation between container and presentational components for maintainable codebases.

‚ñ∫ Use container/presentational component separation patterns
‚ñ∫ Extract business logic into custom hooks for reusability
‚ñ∫ Keep components focused on rendering and user interaction
‚ñ∫ Implement proper prop boundaries - avoid excessive prop drilling
‚ñ∫ Use compound components for complex UI patterns

### State Management
Organize application state with clear boundaries between local and global state management strategies.

‚ñ∫ Use local state for component-specific data
‚ñ∫ Implement global state for cross-component shared data
‚ñ∫ Keep API calls in dedicated service layers
‚ñ∫ Use React Query or SWR for server state management
‚ñ∫ Avoid storing derived data in state - compute on render

## üß™ TESTING ORGANIZATION

### Test Structure
Organize tests for rapid feedback loops and clear separation between different testing strategies and scopes.

‚ñ∫ Co-locate unit tests with source files for tight feedback loops
‚ñ∫ Place component tests alongside their components (.test.js files)
‚ñ∫ Organize integration tests at project root in tests/ directory
‚ñ∫ Structure e2e tests in tests/e2e/ for full user journey validation
‚ñ∫ Use descriptive test names that explain behavior, not implementation

### Test Discipline
Maintain clean test environments through proper setup, teardown, and isolation practices that prevent test pollution.

‚ñ∫ Use single test environment with proper cleanup between tests
‚ñ∫ Implement test isolation through cleanup, not file duplication
‚ñ∫ Mock external dependencies consistently across test suites
‚ñ∫ Clean up test artifacts immediately after test completion
‚ñ∫ Avoid creating test-{feature}.js files scattered throughout project

## üìÅ FILE CREATION RULES

### Creation Boundaries
Prevent project bloat through strict file creation policies that prioritize editing existing files over creating new ones.

‚ñ∫ NEVER create files unless explicitly requested by user
‚ñ∫ ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new files
‚ñ∫ ASK before creating any new directories or file structures
‚ñ∫ Avoid creating temporary files without immediate cleanup strategy
‚ñ∫ Document file creation decisions for future reference

### Organization Standards
Structure projects with clear architectural boundaries and logical grouping of related functionality.

‚ñ∫ Group related files in logical directory structures  
‚ñ∫ Use consistent naming conventions across similar file types
‚ñ∫ Maintain clear separation between source code and configuration
‚ñ∫ Keep documentation co-located with relevant code when possible
‚ñ∫ Follow established project conventions for new file placement

## üîÑ GIT WORKFLOW STANDARDS

### Commit Practices
Create meaningful git history through semantic commits and proper branching strategies that support team collaboration.

‚ñ∫ Use semantic commit messages: "feat:", "fix:", "refactor:", "docs:"
‚ñ∫ Write commits that explain WHY changes were made, not just WHAT
‚ñ∫ Keep commits atomic - one logical change per commit
‚ñ∫ Use present tense in commit messages ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
‚ñ∫ Reference issues or tickets in commit messages when applicable

### Branch Strategy
Organize development work through clear branching patterns that support parallel development and clean integration.

‚ñ∫ Use main branch for stable, production-ready code
‚ñ∫ Create feature branches for new development work (feature/description)
‚ñ∫ Use fix branches for bug repairs (fix/issue-description)
‚ñ∫ Keep branches focused on single features or fixes
‚ñ∫ Delete merged branches to maintain clean repository

### Auto-Commit Integration
Leverage automatic commit functionality through $save command for seamless development checkpoint creation.

‚ñ∫ Significant changes trigger auto-commits: new features, bug fixes, major progress
‚ñ∫ Auto-commits use semantic format: "feat: implement X" or "fix: resolve Y"
‚ñ∫ Manual commits override auto-commit for specific messaging needs
‚ñ∫ Review auto-commit messages before pushing to remote repositories
‚ñ∫ Use auto-commits for rapid development cycles, manual commits for collaboration
