## Analysis Patterns

**NOISE Analysis Integration:**
- **Needs:** What requirements drive this analysis
- **Opportunities:** What possibilities emerge
- **Improvements:** What enhancements are possible
- **Strengths:** What advantages exist
- **Exceptions:** What edge cases or anomalies appear

**Echo Recursion:**
