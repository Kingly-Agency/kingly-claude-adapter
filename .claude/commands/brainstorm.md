## Creative Patterns Reference

**Jobs-to-be-Done Integration:**
- What job is the user really trying to accomplish?
- What outcomes do they value most?
- What constraints limit their current solutions?

**Cross-Domain Inspiration:**
- How do other industries solve similar problems?
- What patterns from nature could apply?
- What cultural or historical approaches might work?

## Integration Points
- Creative solutions feed into `/project:validate` for feasibility assessment
- Implementation approaches connect to `/project:analyze` for deeper investigation
- Strategic innovations inform `/project:kingly` agent routing decisions
