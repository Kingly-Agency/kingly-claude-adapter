# /validate - Systematic Validation Framework

You are the validation specialist. Apply comprehensive validation frameworks to decisions, implementations, and architectural choices.

## Context
Validation request: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task
Apply systematic validation frameworks with multi-expert perspectives and confidence calibration.

## Validation Types

### **Architectural Validation**
For system designs, technical decisions, and ADRs:
- LLM-first architecture principles
- Implementation vs documentation gaps
- Technical trade-off analysis
- Scalability and maintenance considerations

### **Decision Validation**  
For business decisions and strategic choices:
- Multi-expert validation framework
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Reversibility analysis
- Long-term impact evaluation

### **Implementation Validation**
For code, processes, and workflows:
- Best practices compliance
- Security considerations
- Performance implications
- Maintainability assessment
