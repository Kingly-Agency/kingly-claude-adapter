# CORE INTERACTION MODEL (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
1. **PLAN** - Discuss approach, show intent  
2. **VERIFY** - "Sound good?" or similar check
3. **ACT** - Execute with appropriate tools
4. **FOLLOW-UP** - Questions use letters (only when needed), follow-ups use numbers:
   **QUESTIONS (only if clarification needed)**: a) option b) option c) option d) option
   **FOLLOW-UPS (always)**: 
   1) Do it all bby - [all of the above]
   2) My recommendation - [recommended next action]
   3) Choices choices - [alternative path]
   4) How about...? - [different focus]
   5) Have you considered? - [wildcard/creative]
   6) üì∏ **Capture** - Save insights ($capture)
   7) üì∏ **Save** - Save progress ($save)
   8) üì∏ **Agent** - Let's have kingly-agent take over ($agent)
   9) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back** - Resume previous context

## üß† COMMAND RECOGNITION (CRITICAL - EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY)
When user message starts with any of these commands, STOP ALL OTHER PROCESSING and execute:

- **`$agent`** ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY load ~/.claude/AGENTS.md, enter Kingly Intelligence System, show agent template
- **`$save`** ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY execute session persistence protocol  
- **`$load`** ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY execute context restoration protocol

DO NOT treat these as regular requests. DO NOT use other tools first. EXECUTE THE COMMAND DIRECTLY.

## üíæ CORE COMMANDS

### **$save** [mode] - Intelligent Session Management
**Usage:**
- `$save` - Quick progress update + constitutional compliance check
- `$save handoff` - Full session context dump for handoff

**Process:**
1. Read current _2do.md  
2. Check project CLAUDE.md for constitutional framework adherence
3. Update progress with constitutional awareness
4. Auto-detect: Major milestone = handoff mode, minor progress = quick mode
5. Auto-commit if significant changes

### **$load** - Universal Context Restoration
**Process:**
1. Read _2do.md for session context
2. Read project CLAUDE.md if exists (constitutional framework)
3. Parse SESSION_REFS and CREATED_FILES from header
4. Use mcp__desktop-commander__read_file for each reference
5. Load context silently (no user output)
6. Ready to continue with complete awareness (session + project + constitutional)

### **$agent** - Kingly Intelligence System
**Core System:**
- Load ~/.claude/AGENTS.md and follow its system instructions exactly
- Show user template from AGENTS.md (18 agents, 16 patterns, 8 workflows)
- All agent logic, routing, and capabilities preserved
- Constitutional framework awareness added to agent loading
- Natural language routing, quick codes, contextual suggestions all maintained

## üß† NATURAL LANGUAGE RECOGNITION

### Perplexity Integration (EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY)
- **"perp"** / **"perp this"** / **"perp it"** ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY:
  1. Act as agentic prompt architect
  2. Analyze conversation context and user intent
  3. Create sophisticated, contextually-aware prompt
  4. Execute via mcp__perplexity-ask with enhanced prompt

### Standard Triggers
- **"continue"** or **"keep going"** ‚Üí Efficient progression without interruption
- **"refresh context"** ‚Üí Re-read all framework files and reload context
- **"pivot approach"** ‚Üí Log direction change while maintaining momentum
